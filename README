##Requirements:

#C packages: 

hdf5 --- tested with version 1.10.0_0

fftw --- tested with version 3.3.5 


#Python packages:

h5py --- tested with version 2.6.0

cython --- tested with version 0.25.1_0

numpy --- tested with version 1.11.2_1

scipy --- tested with version 0.17.0_0


##Build and Run Instructions:

* First setup the cython files:

`python setup.py build_ext --inplace`

Then test using the test script

`python stored_IC.py`

If all goes well the script will run 3 simulations, before passing. If it doesn't pass, I am sorry about that :(

Now you can edit the DNS_2D_Visco.py script to change the initial conditions, and the config.cfg file to change the parameters of the simulation.
